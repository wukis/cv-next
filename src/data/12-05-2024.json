      "reference": "When I joined anwalt.de, Jonas very quickly (I believe it was in the first day or two) stood out from the rest of my new colleagues as a strongly goal oriented, let's-cut-through-the-nonsense professional. He and I quickly and easily agreed to maintain very direct and transparent communication for the sake of both speed and clarity of collaboration.\n\nIt wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on Jonas's programming skills, but I can vouch for his experience with both my hands. He doesn't look into flashy and fancy solutions, but always puts functionality, maintainability and performance first - the cool and trendy stuff, if fitting the picture, is considered a good bonus on top, but not the main focus for him. Speaking from the perspective of DevOps and Infrastructure, such an attitude is pure gold - not because modern solutions and approaches to solving problems are bad, but because they aren't always mature enough. Jonas won't let something fitting this description slip through and make everyone's life a living nightmare!\n\nAlthough considerately outspoken and vocal, I also find Jonas an introspective and quite self-aware expert. When entering a topic or an area he's not deeply familiar with, he would always start with an open disclaimer about it and would respectively tag his comments as ideas, rather than instructions to solving a problem. The latter would in fact be a sensible description of his style of work altogether - he doesn't impose his thoughts and suggestions, no matter how good these are, but always discussed them with his colleagues to reach the most optimal solution and implementation possible.\n\nAll this said, I can't skip the fact Jonas and I have (naturally, I would say) had our disagreements and heated discussions, but it has always been at a very professional level. He's simply not the type of person who would put up with something that's either not working well or is overly complicated to deal with - rest assured, he'd speak up his mind! Which is even more of a reason for me to recommend Jonas as an excellent colleague, whom one can truly only appreciate working with."

Jonas is definitely not afraid to speak his mind, take on challanges and display great leadership.\n\nI really valued working together with him and if you're looking to boost your IT and development capabilities, definitely reach out to Jonas!"

His proactive attitude and attention to detail have significantly enhanced our project structures. \n\nJonas played a crucial role in implementing significant enhancements to our projects and has played a pivotal role in enhancing the CI/CD pipelines in collaboration with the DevOps team for several projects.\n\nI strongly recommend Jonas not only as a highly capable professional but also as a dedicated team player.
